In English, \u2018an\u2019 is used for the plural of a word that starts with \u2018a\u2019, such as \u2018apple\u2019. For example, in \u2018an apple a day\u2019, \u2018an\u2019 is used to indicate that the word \u2018apple\u2019 is being used as a singular noun. In \u2018and\u2019, \u2018and\u2019 \u2018an\u2019 is used to indicate that the word \u2018and\u2019 is being used as a plural noun. For example, \u2018and an apple a day\u2019 is not correct. In \u2018an\u2019, you can use \u2018an\u2019 for both singular and plural nouns."
